      <h2 class="post">I play Xonotic now</h2>
      <p><a href="https://freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> has been my server operating system of choice for the past two decades. I may have started on Linux (with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walnut_Creek_CDROM">Walnut Creek</a> CD of Linux Slackware), but after I got out of university I started toying around with the *BSD flavors (particularly FreeBSD and OpenBSD). FreeBSD is clean, has sensible defaults, and frankly, the ports and package system is just hassle-free when it comes to getting up and running. If you&rsquo;re at all wanting a Unix system that is dependable, a great platform for development, and running simple services, FreeBSD is hard to beat.</p>
<p>Over the past year or so I started toying around with <a href="https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/jails/">FreeBSD Jails</a>.  While I&rsquo;m not an expert on the topic, they&rsquo;ve proven useful for a few services that I like to run on our home network. Best of all, they run in independent environments, meaning I don&rsquo;t have to worry about them stomping on each other as they get upgraded and maintained over time.</p>
<p>All of this leads me to <a href="https://xonotic.org">Xonotic</a>. I was bouncing around the internet recently and came across some old news about Unreal Tournament getting cancelled. In the process I discovered that some open source developers had taken the open sourced Quake Engine code and used it to build Xonotic.</p>
<p>Waxing nostalgic, I decided to throw up a jail and install it on my main server. I fired it up and was immediately back in my 20s, running through platform maps fragging everyone I could.</p>
<p>This game is fun! The graphics are definitely 2006/2007 era, but I think that&rsquo;s part of the charm for me. It&rsquo;s fast moving and visceral, and the player models and weaposn are really cool and well done. Now that I&rsquo;ve got a dedicated server, it&rsquo;s pretty trivial to log on and play a 5-10 minute round of Deathmatch or Capture the Flag. And one of the things I like about it is that the gameplay options are straight ahead. I was up and running with a dedicated server very quickly. A few key mappings later and I was running through the deathmatch map rotation.</p>
<p>The one thing that was <em>not</em> straightforward was the configuration script for the server. The sample startup scripts that were supplied with the base install of Xonotic were designed around a Linux installation structure. Since I installed via the FreeBSD packages, the filenames were slightly different, and the executable path and the data path for maps was different. It took a little mucking around to identify the path differences and adjust the script accordingly. What I ended up doing was creating a xonotic server user inside the jail to run the server, and set up a <em>server.cfg</em> file in that user directory to set the defaults for the server to run. Finally, I created a server startup script called <em>xonotic_server_freebsd.sh</em> to launch the server by reading in the config files, and then wrapped all that in a script called <em>xonotic_tmux.sh</em>, that launches a tmux session, kicks off the startup script, and detaches the session. This allows me to keep the session running on the server after I log off, but also allows me to ssh in, reattach to the session and make modifications as needed.</p>
<p>Needless to say, I&rsquo;m having way more fun with this than I should be.</p>
