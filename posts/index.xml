      <description>Nothing more to say other than the title. Kyle Kinane&amp;rsquo;s new special is amazing! It&amp;rsquo;s going to be released on YouTube on March 30th, but I was more than happy to pay for the paid release version on 800 Pound Gorilla. Highly recommend you do the same!

      <description>Last night was the first Houston Dynamo home game of the season. For a lot of reasons I was excited for this one.
New Ownership &amp;amp; Management New owner Ted Segal bought into the club at the end of the 2021 season, and since then has proven that he&amp;rsquo;s serious about making this club a serious contender in the league, and is willing to invest to do so. This season opener was the first opportunity to get a glimpse of what that might look like.</description>

      <description>It&amp;rsquo;s 2023&amp;hellip;who the heck is still blogging? I&amp;rsquo;ve never been a committed blogger. I&amp;rsquo;ve created six or seven different blogs in my lifetime, including rolling my own static blog engine back in the day, and let them die out over time. I was an early adopter of Userland Radio, Blogger, and Tumblr.
So, why this blog? Why now? In short, the tools have just become so easy and so controllable, and the world has become more interesting, and I feel like I have something to say.</description>
