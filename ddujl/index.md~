When I was a kid in high school and college I loved the programming magazines of the time. I was just getting familiar with Unix systems, and hacking around on the campus AIX and Solaris systems. Somewhere my freshman year I discovered Linux and installed Slackware on a hard drive partition.

I came across this DVD archive of several programming languages from the time and I felt a need to preserve them here for posterity. Inside you can find:

* [Dr. Dobbs Journal]("ddujl/articles/DDJ")

* <a href="ddujl/articles/CUJ">The C++ User Journal</a>

* <a href="ddujl/articles/TPJ">The Programmers Journal</a>

* <a href="ddujl/articles/SA">The System Administrators Journal</a>
