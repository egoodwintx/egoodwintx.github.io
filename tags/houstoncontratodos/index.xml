      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the first Houston Dynamo home game of the season. For a lot of reasons I was excited for this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-ownership--management&#34;&gt;New Ownership &amp;amp; Management&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New owner Ted Segal bought into the club at the end of the 2021 season, and since then has proven that he&amp;rsquo;s serious about making this club a serious contender in the league, and is willing to invest to do so. This season opener was the first opportunity to get a glimpse of what that might look like. Sure, last season included the signing of Hector Herrera, a top Mexican player from Atletico Madrid, but this was the first full offseason that the new ownership has had to sign new players, upgrade the facilities, and make front and back-office staff changes. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into everything that&amp;rsquo;s been done, but I point all this out because one of the changes involved upgrades to Shell Energy stadium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
