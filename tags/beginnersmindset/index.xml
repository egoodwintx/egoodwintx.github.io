      <description>&lt;p&gt;After a two year hiatus, I&amp;rsquo;m back to chronicling my thoughts online. I&amp;rsquo;ve been thinking alot about the early days of the internet and how much fun it was to be a part of it. Blogrolls and RSS feeds and just feeling like you could roll your own blog software and make something that was functional.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Maybe its all the AI talk about how content&amp;rsquo;s not going to matter anymore, because the bots are going to just autogenerate it for you now. I&amp;rsquo;ve always liked an underdog story, so maybe its time to revive human-generated content at the tail end of the human internet. At the very least it will be training material for the machines :)&lt;/p&gt;</description>
