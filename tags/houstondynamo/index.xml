      <title>The Ups and Downs of Being a Dynamo Fan</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Being a Dynamo fan is not for the faint of heart. After a decade of malinvestment and terrible strategy moves (e.g. permanently trading away an international player slot on the roster), a definite case could be made that it&amp;rsquo;s easier building an expansion team franchise from scratch than rebuilding the Dynamo. And after seeing St. Louis and FC Cincinnati this year, I don&amp;rsquo;t think many would argue the reverse.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Still, a lot has been accomplished in a relatively short amount of time, and hope springs eternal in H-Town.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>That felt good! Dynamo vs. Galaxy</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;What a game! Not the prettiest soccer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, but being in the stands for the Dynamo/LA Galaxy game felt good. At this point we&amp;rsquo;ve:&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Been undefeated at home this season&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Maintained a clean sheet at home for all three games&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Got a player (Amine Bassi) who has gone four games and scored a penalty shot in each game. This is the longest consecutive penalty shot streak in MLS history.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Got a solid back-line and midfield setup that can manuever around the field and create open spaces to play into as well as service from the back.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;li&gt;Have a team that is controlling the ball and is generally possessive for most of the game.&lt;/li&gt;&#xA;&lt;/ul&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;What we don&amp;rsquo;t have:&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <title>Dynamo Home Opener vs. Austin FC</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Last night was the first Houston Dynamo home game of the season. For a lot of reasons I was excited for this one.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;h1 id=&#34;new-ownership--management&#34;&gt;New Ownership &amp;amp; Management&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;New owner Ted Segal bought into the club at the end of the 2021 season, and since then has proven that he&amp;rsquo;s serious about making this club a serious contender in the league, and is willing to invest to do so. This season opener was the first opportunity to get a glimpse of what that might look like. Sure, last season included the signing of Hector Herrera, a top Mexican player from Atletico Madrid, but this was the first full offseason that the new ownership has had to sign new players, upgrade the facilities, and make front and back-office staff changes. I won&amp;rsquo;t go into everything that&amp;rsquo;s been done, but I point all this out because one of the changes involved upgrades to Shell Energy stadium.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
