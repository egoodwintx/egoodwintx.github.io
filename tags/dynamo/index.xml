      <description>Being a Dynamo fan is not for the faint of heart. After a decade of malinvestment and terrible strategy moves (e.g. permanently trading away an international player slot on the roster), a definite case could be made that it&amp;rsquo;s easier building an expansion team franchise from scratch than rebuilding the Dynamo. And after seeing St. Louis and FC Cincinnati this year, I don&amp;rsquo;t think many would argue the reverse.&#xA;Still, a lot has been accomplished in a relatively short amount of time, and hope springs eternal in H-Town.</description>

      <description>What a game! Not the prettiest soccer I&amp;rsquo;ve ever seen, but being in the stands for the Dynamo/LA Galaxy game felt good. At this point we&amp;rsquo;ve:&#xA;Been undefeated at home this season Maintained a clean sheet at home for all three games Got a player (Amine Bassi) who has gone four games and scored a penalty shot in each game. This is the longest consecutive penalty shot streak in MLS history.</description>
