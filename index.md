When I was a kid in high school and college I loved the programming magazines of the time. I was just getting familiar with Unix systems, hacking around on the campus AIX and Solaris systems. Somewhere my freshman year I discovered Linux and installed it on a hard drive partition.

I came across this DVD archive of several programming languages from the time and I felt a need to preserve them here for posterity. Inside you can find:

* Dr. Dobbs Journal

* The C++ User Journal

* The Programmers Journal

* The System Administrators Journal
